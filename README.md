//My Expense Tracker App

I build an small web application where you can manage your daily expenses, like what did you purchased today or how much you money you spended this week, this month & on which product or type of products.

• You can use it easily, it has simple Ui & theme, not too complex or hard to use.
• You can quickly see how much you spended, on top of your screen.
